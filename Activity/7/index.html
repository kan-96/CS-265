<h1> Activity 7 &mdash; Pointers, Functions, Strings </h1>

<p> Follow along, questions will be denoted with a <span  class='question'>Q</span>.  Fill in answers in a
text file called <span class='fn'>act7</span>. </p>

<p> You may work in groups, explain to each other what's happening.  Place the username of each group member at the top of
the file, one per line, yours first, followed by a blank line. </p>

<p> Files for this activity can be found in <span class='fn'>~kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Activities/7/</span> .  Copy
them as needed. </p>

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> You will implement several of the string functions, for practice.  These functions will be gathered in a custom
header file, for clients' use. </p>


<h2> Instructions </h2>

<h3> Setup </h3>

<p> Copy the following files over from the Activity directory: </p>

<ul>
	<li><span class='fn'> mystring.c </span> &mdash; the functions you will write </li>
	<li><span class='fn'> mystring.h </span> &mdash; the prototypes (declarations) of the functions </li>
	<li><span class='fn'> testdriver.c </span> &mdash; the test driver, the main function where you test your functions
	</li>
	<li><span class='fn'> makefile </span></li>
</ul>

<p> Quick tour of these files w/your instructor. </p>

<h4> Colors </h4>

<p> We can use <term>terminal control codes</term> to print using different colors and effects.  Note the string
constants in <span class='fn'>testdriver.c</span>.  <span class='code'>NORM</span> turns all formatting off. </p>

<p> I use these in Bash scripts quite often; a test suite seems to be a handy place for them.  You don't need to use
colors, at all.  They're simply here for your fun.  <span class='code'>\e</span> is the escape character.  In
other places, like Python, you might use <span class='code'>\u001b</span>, or <span class='code'>\033</span> . </p>

<p> <a target='_blank' href='https://dev.to/ifenna__/adding-colors-to-bash-scripts-48g4'>Here are some other color
codes</a> </p>

<h4> Compiling </h4>

<p> These can be compiled all at once: </p>

<div class='cli'>
$ gcc *.c -o stringtest
</div>

<p> Note, header (<span class='fn'>.h</span>) files are <em>not</em> compiled directly. </p>

<p> For larger programs this is wasteful, and will become prohibitively slow, recompiling all files when only a single
file has changed.  We can compile each source file, separately, into an <em>object file</em> (<span
class='fn'>.o</span>).  E.g.: </p>

<div class='cli'>
$ gcc -c mystring.c
</div>

<p> Note, you now have a file <span class='fn'>mystring.o</span> in your directory.  It's machine code, but not a full
program.  We can call the linker to gather all the needed object files into a program: </p>

<div class='cli'>
$ gcc *.o -o stringtest
</div>

<p> Finally, run the program: </p>

<div class='cli'>
$ ./stringtest
</div>

<p> (Yeah, you need to make that <span class='code'>mystrlen</span> function better.) </p>


<h4> The Make Utility </h4>

<p> Remove the executble and the object files from your directory.  Look at the makefile, note that <span
class='code'>testdriver</span> is the top target.  Type: </p>

<div class='cli'>
$ make
</div>

<p>, examine the changes to your directory. </p>

<p> Try making it again, note the result. </p>

<p> Put your name in the header comments in  <span class='fn'>testdriver.c</span>.  Type <span class='code'>make</span> again.
</p>

<script><!--
question( "What happened?" )
//--></script>

<p> Put your name in the header comments in  <span class='fn'>mystring.h</span>.  Type <span class='code'>make</span>
again.  </p>

<script><!--
question( "What happened this time?" )
//--></script>


<h3> Group Instructions </h3>

<p> Write the <span class='fn'>mystrlen</span> function, which takes a (mull-terminated) string, returns the length (the
number of characters before the null-terminator, <span class='code'>'\0'</span>). </p>

<div class='code'>
size_t mystrlen( const char* s ) ;
</div>

<p> Implement <span class='code'>mystrlen</span> in <span class='fn'>mystring.c</span>.  Test until it's correct. </p>

<script><!--
q = "Inline your <span class='code'>mystrlen</span> function in your answer sheet"
question( q )
//--></script>

<p> Now we'll consider a function to copy strings: </p>

<div class='code'>
void mystrcpy( char* t, const char* s ) ;
</div>

<p> , which copies characters from <span class='code'>s</span> to <span class='code'>t</span> up to and including the
null-terminator.  Must assume that <span class='code'>t</span> is of sufficient size. </p>

<p> Before you implement the function, add tests to the main function. </p>

<p> Now implement <span class='code'>mystrcpy</span>.  Remember to add the prototype to the header file.  Looking at the
code you wrote, are there some other tests you might add to your test driver? </p>

<script><!--
q = "Inline your <span class='code'>mystrcpy</span> in your answer sheet"
question( q )
//--></script>


<p> Finally, a function to concatenate strings: </p>

<div class='code'>
void mystrcat( char* t, const char* s ) ;
</div>

<p> It is much like <span class='code'>strcpy</span>, but it appends the contents of <span class='code'>s</span> onto
the end of <span class='code'>t</span> .  Assumes that <span class='code'>t</span> is large enough to store both strings
and the null-terminator. </p>

<p> As before, add tests, then add the function to your library, then, looking at the code, consider more tests you
might add. </p>

<script><!--
q = "Inline your <span class='code'>mystrcat</span> in your answer sheet"
question( q )
//--></script>
