Section 1 

Here's some text, some more content.

Kurt was born a small child.  Did he remember to bring chocolate?

This is a line with multiple occurrences of the string "line", online.

(These next are some verses stolen from The Band's song "The Weight")

   I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead,
   I just need some place where I can lay my head
   "Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
   He just grinned and shook my hand, "no" was all he said.
   
   Catch a cannon ball now to take me down the line,
   my bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time.
   To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
   who sent me here with her regards for everyone.

Do you think Miss Fanny has chocolate?
