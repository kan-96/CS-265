<h1> Lab 3 &mdash; Bash Scripts </h1>

<p> Okay, just follow along, questions will be denoted with a <span  class='question'>Q</span>.  Fill in answers in a
text file called <span class='fn'>lab3</span>. </p>

<p> Files for this lab can be found in <span class='fn'>~kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Labs/Bash</span> . </p>

<ul>
	<li> Look at the examples in the lab directory.  Run them.  Get an understanding. </li>
	<li> Look at (and run) <span class='fn'>eg.bash</span> .  Many examples in there, of simple utilities. </li>
	<li> Also look at <span class='fn'>args.bash</span> and <span class='fn'>rv.bash</span>
		<ul>
			<li> Bring good questions to class </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2> Scripting </h2>

<ul>
	<li> 
		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?  Explain." )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre> [[ 13 &lt; 2 ]] &amp;&amp; echo true </pre>
</div>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?  Explain." )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>if grep chocolate mySettings &amp;&gt;/dev/null ; then
   echo "All we have to decide is what to do with the chocolate that is given us..."
fi</pre>
</div>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?  Explain." )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>x=13
echo $(( x / 5 ))
</pre>
</div>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?  Explain." )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>(( 27 % 2 == 1 ))
echo $?</pre>
</div>
	</li>

	<li> 
		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?  Why were the outputs different?" )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>unset x
( x=12 ; echo "5 $x 13" )
echo "5 $x 13"</pre>
</div>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p> Consider the following file, <span class='fn'>blah</span>: </p>
<div class='file'>
<pre>Item
Another item</pre>
</div>

		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?" )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>for item in $(cat blah) ; do
   echo $item
done</pre>
</div>

		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?" )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>cat blah | while read item ; do
   echo $item
done</pre>
</div>

		<script><!--
			question( "What is the output of the following?" )
			//--></script>
<div class='cli'>
<pre>while read item ; do
   echo $item
done &lt; blah</pre>
</div>

	<li> Write a script called <span class='fn'>count.bash</span> that, for each <b>regular</b> file in the working
		directory, prints the filename, the # of lines, and the # of words to stdout, like this:

<div class='cli'>
<pre>breadIsDangerous.txt 73 431
spellExample 5 21</pre>
</div>

		<p> Do <b>not</b> use <span class='cmd'>find</span> </p>

		<p> You might read up on Parameter expansion in <span class='cmd'>bash</span>, or look at the <span
			class='cmd'>cut</span> utility. </p>

		<p> Test your script with filenames that have spaces in them.  Get it right. </p>

		<script><!--
			question( "Upload <span class='fn'>count.bash</span>" )
			//--></script>
	</li>

	<li> Write a shell script that accepts two file extensions as command line arguments and renames all files with the
	first extension within the current working directory to have the second extension instead. 

		<p> For example: </p>

<div class='cli'>
<pre>$ reextend .log .txt</pre>
</div>

		<p> Would cause <span class='fn'>install.log</span> to be renamed to <span class='fn'>install.txt</span>, and </p>

<div class='cli'>
<pre>$ reextend A B</pre>
</div>

		<p> Would cause <span class='fn'>TADAA</span> to be renamed to <span class='fn'>TADAB</span> .  It would also cause
			<span class='fn'>file.A</span> to be renamed <span class='fn'>file.B</span> . </p>
		
		<p> The script should print out error messages as is appropriate if there is any problem with the command line
		arguments. Test the script with a range of different parameters, including incorrect parameters or missing
		parameters. </p>
		
		<p><b>hint:</b>  See <b>Parameter Expansion</b> in the bash man or info page. </p>

		<p><b>hint:</b>  See what <span class='cmd'>ls -1</span> does. </p>

		<script><!--
			question( "Call this script <span class='fn'>reextend</span> , and upload it w/your lab." )
			//--></script>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p> You just used your favorite ripper to get some songs off a bunch of CDs that you legally purchased.  You set the
		output format, got the bit-rate you wanted, but forgot to set the format for the filenames.  You ended up w/listings
		like this: </p>

		<div><span class='fn'>Led Zeppelin - Over the Hills and Far Away.mp3</span></div>

		<p>, all in the same directory.  What you really wanted was to have the songs in directories by artist, and just the
		song name for the filename: </p>

		<div><span class='fn'>Led Zeppelin/Over the Hills and Far Away.mp3</span></div>
	
		<p> So, write a script that looks in the current directory only for mp3 files, breaks the filename out into artist
		and song title, creates the appropriate directory (if it doesn't already exist), removes the artist and the first '
		- ' from the filename, and moves it into the directory.  </p>

		<script><!--
			question( "Call this script <span class='fn'>organiseMusic</span> , and upload it w/your lab." )
			//--></script>
	</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p> Get the sha-bangs just right.  We'll worry about permissions. </p>

<h2> Submission </h2>

<ul>
	<li> Your labsheet </li>
	<li> <span class='fn'>count.bash</span> </li>
	<li> <span class='fn'>reextend</span> </li>
	<li> <span class='fn'>organiseMusic</span> </li>
</ul>

<!--
<p> There's a <tt>Makefile</tt> in the lab directory that simply checks for existence of your bash scripts, and checks
the syntax (see the <tt>-n</tt> option to bash).  A bunch of setup needs to be done to test your scripts.  I might throw
it in later, but that would make things more complicated. </p>
